## Math Game: A simple math game for kids
The first project from [thecsharpacademy.com](https://thecsharpacademy.com/) build a very simple Math Game app. 
### Requirements:
- [x] You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
- [x] The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
- [x] Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
- [x] You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
- [x] You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted

### Additional Challenges:
- [x] Try to implement levels of difficulty.

- [ ] Add a timer to track how long the user takes to finish the game.
- [x] Add a function that let's the user pick the number of questions.
- [x] Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations

# The C# Academy - MathGame 

## Introduction
In your first project you’ll build a very simple Math Game app. If this is your first time building a project on your own, I suggest you use the C# Academy's series from our C# Foundation area, where we walk you through how to create a console app from scratch, while explaining important concepts in C#. If you have already watched it, or created applications before, this will be a breeze. But it’s still helpful to reinforce your knowledge.

## Requirements
 -  [x] You need to create a Math game containing the 4 basic operations
 -  [x] The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100.
 -  [x] Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
 -  [x] You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
 -  [x] You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.

 ## Challenges
  -  [x] Try to implement levels of difficulty.
  -  [x] Add a timer to track how long the user takes to finish the game.
  -  [x] Add a function that let's the user pick the number of questions.
  -  [x] Create a 'Random Game' option where the players will be presented with questions from random operations

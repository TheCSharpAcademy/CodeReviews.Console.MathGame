My C# Academy project to create a Console App Math Game with the below requirements.

**Requirements**:
* You need to create a Console App Math Game containing the 4 basic operations
* The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100. Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
* Users should be presented with a menu to choose an operation
* You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
* You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.
